# Front-End Playground  

This repository is a collection of front-end projects Iâ€™ve built while practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Each project lives in its own folder and can be opened directly in the browser.

You can find screenshots of the projects inside the `docs/` folder.  
Here are a few examples:
